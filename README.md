# A Decentralized COVID19 CrowdFunding System  
The Medical Research teams are finding it difficult to continue their researches in this pandemic. A crowdfunding system can help the organizations to raise funds.
This system is completely decentralized with Blockchain, so as to remove the middle men, and provide better security against the centralized systems.

# Aim  
* Decentralized Crowd Funding System
* Accept Public Donations in Ethers
* List Registered Organizations/Person
* Register New Organizations Verified by Trustees
* Admin Control to Deployer to Add/Remove Trustees
* Escrow Based Smart Contract for proof-of-funds and a much safer trade
* Registered Organizations/Person can withdraw funds finalized by Trustees/Owner
* Stats to check the raised funds

# The code will be posted here soon.
